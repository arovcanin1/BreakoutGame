# BreakoutGame
FINAL zip file contains two folders named Hard and Easy (created for testing purpose). Each of these folders has three subfolders named _Dificulty_ Everything, _Difficulty_ EXE, and _Difficulty_ assets.

The _Difficulty_ Everything subfolder contains all the necessary files for each difficulty level of my game. The exe subfolder contains an executable file that can be used to run the game without assets. The assets subfolder contains assets that are not being used by any of the other two subfolders but can be used by someone else's game.
